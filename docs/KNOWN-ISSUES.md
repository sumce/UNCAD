# Known Issues And Scope

Keep this list short. An item belongs here only when it is active, intentionally
deferred, or important for support diagnosis.

## Deferred

- U1LX-entered distances are not part of U1U/U1F statistics. This is an
  explicit scope decision, not an accidental omission.

## Intentional Behavior

- Repeating XLAYOUT can create another machine-ID label.
- U1F/U1U do not draw automatic upstream connection geometry.
- A missing online license response fails closed outside the configured grace
  behavior; the customer can enter a new authorization code.

## Environment Limits

- CAD integration tests and real command acceptance require AutoCAD 2022 and
  its .NET assemblies. Core tests should remain runnable without AutoCAD loaded.
- User drawings, customer workbooks, logs, `bin`, `obj`, and `artifacts` are
  local inputs/outputs and are not source-of-truth project files.

## Resolved In 2.3.0

- QuickLine text-only helpers no longer eagerly resolve AutoCAD RX classes.
- Batch U1U no longer opens the comparison dialog twice.
- The U1U comparison window reserves its left selector area before laying out
  the two comparison tables.
